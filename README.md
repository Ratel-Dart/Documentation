Welcome to the **Ratel Framework Documentation** project. This repository provides a comprehensive guide to building backend applications with Ratel, covering:

- **Handlers**: how to expose endpoints using `RatelHandler` and route definitions.
- **Use Case**: implementing application logic, orchestrating business rules, and injecting repository dependencies.
- **Repository**: defining abstract ports and concrete adapters for data persistence.
- **Domain Entities**: annotating models for JSON serialization and database mapping.
- **Dependency Injection**: configuring `GlobalBindings` to wire services, repositories, and use cases.
- **Server Initialization**: bootstrapping your application in `main.dart`, loading environment variables, database configuration, and handler registration.
- **JWT Authentication**: enabling token-based protection with minimal setup and using the built-in JWT library.
